Include "raw" data here-- i.e. files grabbed directly from papers, vizier, etc.
We should also include scripts here that read all of these files, concatenate them,
and make files that are readable by the orbit-fitting codes we want to use. The idea
is to reduce "hand-copying" of data (which tends to introduce mistakes) as much 
as possible.

### Data Sources:
1. ELODIE data, in the "ELODIE_rv_raw.txt", taken from Vizier (Naef et al. 2003) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...410.1051N/abstract).
2. AFOE data, in the "ELODIE_rv_raw", taken from Vizier (Naef et al. 2003) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...410.1051N/abstract).
3. SOPHIE data, in the "SOPHIE_rv_raw.txt", taken from Table A2 of Courcol et al. 2015 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...581A..38C/abstract).
4. Lick-Hamilton data, in the "CLS_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 6 of Rosenthal et al. 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/abe23c/meta#apjsabe23ct6).
5. Keck-HIRES data, including both pre- and post-upgrade data, in the "CLS_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 6 of Rosenthal et al. 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/abe23c/meta#apjsabe23ct6).
6. APF-Levy data, in the "CLS_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 6 of Rosenthal et al. 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/abe23c/meta#apjsabe23ct6).

Master data files generated by "HD190360_DataSetup.py" are concatenated data including all sources, cleaned and formatted for radvel as input.
