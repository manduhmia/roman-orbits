Trimmed first 75% of chains. Period of farthest companion could stand to be 
slightly more converged but not much-- it's a long tail and I believe overall 
it's sampled well. Parameters agree well with Rosenthal+ 21 but our period 
posterior for d is broader, which makes sense to me because I ran the chains
longer than generic radvel would have. This slightly changes the parameter
dists for the inner planets too much not much.
