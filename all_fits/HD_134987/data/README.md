Include "raw" data here-- i.e. files grabbed directly from papers, vizier, etc.
We should also include scripts here that read all of these files, concatenate them,
and make files that are readable by the orbit-fitting codes we want to use. The idea
is to reduce "hand-copying" of data (which tends to introduce mistakes) as much 
as possible.

### Data Sources:
1. UCLES data, in the "UCLES_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from NASA Exoplanet Archive (Jones et al. 2010) (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/data/ExoData/0074/0074500/data/UID_0074500_RVC_004.tbl).
2. Keck-HIRES data, including both pre- and post-upgrade data, in the "HIRES_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 6 of Rosenthal et al. 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/abe23c/meta#apjsabe23ct6).
3. HARPS data, including both pre- and post-upgrade data, in the "HARPS_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from the HARPS RVbank (Trifonov et al. 2020) (https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/trifonov/HARPS_RVBank.html).

Master data files generated by "HD134987_DataSetup.py" are concatenated data including all sources, cleaned and formatted for radvel as input.
