RV params for planet b totally consistent with Rosenthal+ 2021; planet c params 
we're finding are inconsistent with theirs at just over 1sigma-- 
our sma is higher, msini is higher, and our eccentricity is a little lower. 
Probably just because we're using more data. 

Trimmed first 30% of the chain produced from the default run.
