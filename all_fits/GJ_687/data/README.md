Include "raw" data here-- i.e. files grabbed directly from papers, vizier, etc.
We should also include scripts here that read all of these files, concatenate them,
and make files that are readable by the orbit-fitting codes we want to use. The idea
is to reduce "hand-copying" of data (which tends to introduce mistakes) as much 
as possible.

### Data Sources:
1. HET-HRS data, in the "HRS_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 5 of Burt et al. 2014 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/2/114).
2. Keck-HIRES data, including both pre- and post-upgrade data, in the "HIRES_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Table 6 of Rosenthal et al. 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/abe23c/meta#apjsabe23ct6).
3. APF-Levy data, in the "APF_rv_raw.txt" file, taken from Vizier (Feng et al. 2020) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..250...29F/abstract).
4. CARMENES data, in the "CARMENES_rv_raw.csv" file, taken from CARMENES DR 1 (Ribas et al. 2023) (http://carmenes.cab.inta-csic.es/gto/jsp/dr1Public.jsp).

Master data files generated by "GJ687_DataSetup.py" are concatenated data including all sources, cleaned and formatted for radvel as input.
