Include scripts here to run orbit-fits. This should be (e.g. for radvel) both 
setup files, final model report, and bash scripts that run things like `radvel fit` and `radvel mcmc`
in order to make it as easily reproducible as possible. We should call our script
that runs our "adopted" fit "run_orbit.sh" to make it easy to (for example) collect and 
re-run all the fits at once for all targets.
